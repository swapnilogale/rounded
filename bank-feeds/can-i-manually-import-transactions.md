# Can I manually import transactions?

Yes, you can manually import transactions using QIF or CSV file formats. This allows you to reconcile your income against your bank transactions.

**Before you begin**: Log in to your bank account and export transactions (CSV or QIF format) you want to import into Rounded.

### To manually import transactions

1. From the top menu, click **Money > Expenses**.
   If you have not set up expenses before, the **Keep Track of Expenses** option displays.

3. Select the file (CSF or QIF) and click **Import Now**. 
   The transactions are now imported into Rounded and displayed on the **Expenses** tab.
