# Can I remind clients about overdue invoices?

Yes, you can send an automated email to clients about overdue invoices.

**Important**: Make sure you mark your invoices as paid before the due date, else your clients may still receive automated emails about overdue invoices.

* If you accept payment via Stripe, Rounded will automatically mark your invoices as paid when you receive payment from your clients. 
* If your clients pay you via bank transfer, you will have to manually mark the invoices as paid, when you receive the payment.


### To set up automated emails

1) Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, click the thumbnail on the top right and select **Settings**.
