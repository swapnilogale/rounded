# How do I import client data from other systems?

Use the **Import** function on the Clients page to import client data from other systems such as Harvest, Xero or FreshBooks. This saves you the trouble of creating client/customer information from scratch in Rounded.


### To import client data

1. Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, click **Clients**.
A list of clients currently active in the system is displayed.
**Tip**: By default, this page will only display all active clients. Use the drop-down to view archived clients.

2. From the Import drop-down select Harvest or Xero. 

 a. **Harvest** - Log in to your Harvest account and export your client information to a CSV. Import the CSV into Rounded.
 b. **Xero** - Select the contacts CSV file you would have exported from Xero and click Import Now to import the data into Rounded.
 
The client data is now imported into Rounded and displayed on the Clients page.
