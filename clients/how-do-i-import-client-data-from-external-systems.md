# How do I import client data from other systems?

Use the **Import** function to import client data from other systems such as Harvest, Xero or FreshBooks. This saves you the trouble of creating client/customer information from scratch in Rounded.


### To import client data

1. Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, click **Clients**.
A list of clients currently active in the system is displayed.
**Tip**: By default, this page will only display all active clients. Use the drop-down to view archived clients.

2. From the Import drop-down select Harvest or Xero.
