# Importing expenses

If you do not have the Bank Connect feature enabled on your account \(Basic account\), the Importing expenses feature allows you to import expenses from an external file \(QIF or CSV formats\), in order for you to manually add expenses to your Rounded account.

## To import expenses from an external file

1. From the top menu, click **Money > Expenses**.
   If you have not set up expenses before, the **Keep Track of Expenses** option displays.
