# Can I accept payments via a credit card?

Yes. Rounded allows you to integrate Stripe with your Rounded account, so that clients can pay your invoices with their credit card.

**Note**: While Rounded does not charge any transaction free, Stripe _may_ charge fees per transaction.

### To set up your Rounded account for Stripe

1. Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, click the thumbnail on the top right and select **My account**.

If you have an existing Stripe account, sign in and authorise the Stripe app to integrate with Rounded.

If you do not have an existing Stripe account, complete the form and authorise the Stripe app to integrate with Rounded.
**Note**: Stripe may require additional information about you or your business before allowing you to accept credit card payments with Stripe.

Once you are taken back to Rounded, you will now see that you have successfully connected your Stripe account to your Rounded account. You are now ready to accept payments from your clients via a credit card.
