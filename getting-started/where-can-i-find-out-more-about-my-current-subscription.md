# Where can I find out more about subscriptions?

Use the **Subscriptions** tab \(under **My Account**\) to find out more or upgrade to a new subscription plan.

If you are new to Rounded, and still on a free trial, you can upgrade your account at any stage using this tab.

The top section displays the number of days remaining on your trial.

**Note**: If you choose to upgrade to a paid subscription while you still in the trial period, your credit card will not be charged until after the end of the trial finish date.
