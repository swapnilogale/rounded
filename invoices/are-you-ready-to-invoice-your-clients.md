# Create a new invoice

You can create a new invoice either from:
a. The dashboard, or 
b. The Invoices page (Invoices > Invoices from the top menu)

### Before you begin

Make sure you have added a client in Rounded. You can either [add a client manually](/clients/can-i-add-clients-manually.md) or [import client data from other systems](/clients/how-do-i-import-client-data-from-external-systems.md). This will ensure you are tracking your invoices and payments accurately against the correct client.

A list of all your clients is available on the **Clients** page, accessible from the top menu.

### Create a draft invoice

1) Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, navigate to **Invoices &gt; Invoices**.  
   The **Invoices** page displays.

2) On the Invoices page, click **New Invoice**.

4) Complete/Verify the following:

* **Company Name (Under From), ABN and Address**- This will be automatically populated from when you set up your account on Rounded.

* **General description** - Type in an overall description of the work done on the project.

* **Description of work done, hours worked and rate** - This will be automatically populated if you have used the timer feature to track your time. If you haven't, you can still add individual line items detailing the work done.

* **Is the invoice amount applicable for GST** - Tick this if you charge GST for your work. 

5) Click **Save Draft** to save your changes.
