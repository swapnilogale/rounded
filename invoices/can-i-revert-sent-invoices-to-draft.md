# Can I revert a sent invoice back to draft?

If you have sent off an invoice to your client and found out that it had some information missing, or the client has requested you to review the invoice, you do not have to create a new invoice. 

You can revert the sent invoice to draft, make the necessary changes and resend the invoice with changes.

### To revert a sent invoice to draft:

1) On the Invoices page, open the invoice you sent to the client.
2) From the right, under Options, select **Revert to draft**.

The following message displays.

3) Click **Yep, make it a draft** to revert the invoice back to draft.

**Note:** If the invoice has been paid and you do not want to delete any payment associated with the invoice, click **Nope, keep it sent**

In this case, it would be recommended to create a new invoice.
