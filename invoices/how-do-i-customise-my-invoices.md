# Customise my invoices

The invoice is perhaps the most important document your client will see  coming from your business and hence it is important to present a professional image of your freelance business via the invoice. 
You can customise your invoice to match your company brand, colours and style. 

There are 2 ways to customise your invoices:

* Content settings - This refers to the content that is displayed on the invoices, including business information, payment details and email message text.

* Appearance settings - This refers to the way your invoice looks in terms of colour, logos etc.

It is important to customise your invoice to present this information professionally to the clients, so that it makes it easier for them to pay you for your work on time.

## Content settings

Use the **Settings** page under My Account to customise your business information, invoices and quotes, credit cards and emails and reminders.

1) Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, click the thumbnail on the top right and select **Settings**.

The **Settings** page displays.

2) Under **Invoice and Quote settings**, complete the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Default payment terms \(days\) | Type in the payment terms \(days\) applicable to your invoice. This will be displayed on your invoice as the default days for your client to pay you for your invoice. |
| Numbering system | Select a numbering system for your invoices/quotes. You can choose from a simple incremental numbering or a client name prefixed to the numbering. For ex. CL001, CL002 etc. All your invoices for this client will be numbered automatically using this value incrementally.|
| Payment details | Type in the bank details where you want to be paid. Make sure you have the correct bank details \(BSB, Account number & name\). **Note**: Do not type in your Stripe details here. Once you have integrated Stripe with your bank, the link will be automatically included on the invoice. |
| Footer note | Type in a customised footer for your invoices/quotes. |
| Invoice message subject | Type in a customised default invoice message subject. This will display on your invoice messages. **Tip:** You can also edit it dynamically before sending it out. |
| Invoice message | Type in a default body text for your invoice message. **Tip:** You can also edit it dynamically before sending it out. |


3) Click **Save Changes** to make your changes to the account.

You can:
* **Change the Stripe colour** - the colour as a left border on your invoice.
* **Change the Heading colour** - the colour for all your headings, example From, To, General Description etc. 
**Note**: You can also personalise the invoice using the hex colour that matches your brand.
* **Display client address**: By default, the invoice does not contain the client's mailing address. If you tick this option, the client address is displayed.
* **Display quantity column**: Tick this option if you want to display the rate and quantity columns on your invoice. 
**Tip:** There may be instances where you want to charge a flat fee or a separate fee for individual work done on the project, so you may not want to display the rate and quantity columns.
* **Display purchase order number**: Tick this option if you want to display the purchase order number on the invoice. 
**Tip:** If this is a one off project for the client, you may want to not have a purchase order number. For ongoing work or projects, it is recommended you track your work using unique purchase order numbers.
