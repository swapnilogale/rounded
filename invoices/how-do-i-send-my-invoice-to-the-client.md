# Sending my invoice to the client

The most critical part of using Rounded is being able to send your invoice to your client, in order to get paid for the work done. An invoice is an accurate representation of the work done on a project for the client.

You can send your invoice to the client from the Draft invoice screen.

### How to send the invoice

**Tip**: Before you send the invoice to the client, preview (using the **Preview** button) the invoice to make sure you have completed all the fields and uploaded your logo.

To send the invoice:

1) Open the Invoice you want to send and from the right, click **Ready to Send**.

A new panel slides out from the right.

If you have selected the client you want to send this invoice to, the email address is automatically pre-populated with information from the invoice.

2) Type in any additional email addresses for the client or modify any email details, if needed. 

3) Click **Send Invoice**.
The invoice is sent to the client via email. 

**Important** - If you navigate away from the invoice panel, all your changes will be lost.  

### Send invoice options

* **BCC myself**: Tick this option if you want to email yourself a copy of this invoice. By default, an email is sent to your email address as a BCC recipient. 

* **Online invoice link**: Tick this option if you want to send your client a link to your invoice instead of an attached PDF.

* **Attach invoice PDF**: If you click the Attach invoice PDF option, the client will see the invoice as a PDF attachment in their email.
