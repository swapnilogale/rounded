a. **Get a PDF** - Select this option to generate and view a PDF of your invoice. This will allow you to view how the invoice is presented to the client as a PDF document. If you are not entirely happy with the look, it allows you to edit and customise your invoice before you send it to the client.

b. **Accept credit cards** - If you haven't set up your business to accept credit card payments via Stripe, select this option to set up your Stripe account. 
**Note: **If you have set up your Stripe account already, you will not see this option.

c. **See client view** - Select this option to view the invoice as it would appear to the client. This allows you to view and make changes, if any, before sending off the invoice to the client.
The client view of the invoice displays the invoice and gives the client options to request a change to the invoice, download a PDF or pay the invoice.

c. **Mark as sent** - If you want to mark the invoice as sent, select this option. This is the same as sending the invoice using the Ready to Send feature.

d. **Delete** - If you want to delete the invoice, select this option.
**Note**: All the information on the invoice will be lost if you delete the invoice.
