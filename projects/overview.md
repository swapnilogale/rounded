# Projects    

Rounded allows you to create projects against clients so that you can:
a. Quote estimated hours to be spent
b. Track actual time spent
c. Bill the clients for work done


## Why do I need to create separate projects?

You could be working on multiple tasks for a client and charging different rates for each of these pieces of work. 

Setting up these tasks as separate projects allows you accurately track any piece of work done for the client. Setting up projects also help with analysing, estimating, quoting and tracking for similar future pieces of work.
