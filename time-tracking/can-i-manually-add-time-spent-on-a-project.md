# Can I manually add time spent on a project? 

Yes, you can manually add or log time against a project. For example, you were at a client site and you need to log this time against the project to be billed to the client. 

**Before you begin**: We recommend setting up a project (for a client) to track time against, before you start using the **Time Tracking** feature.
See [Where do I create a new project](/projects/where-do-i-create-a-new-project.md) for more details.


### To track time manually

1) From the top menu, click **Timer > Time Tracking**.
   The **Time tracking** page displays. 
   
2) On the Time Tracking page, click **Manual entry**.
   The Add time entry panel slides out from the right.

   a. **Description**: Add a description of the task. For example, logo design.
   
   b. **Date**: Select the date for which you want to add the time entry for.
   
   c. **Project**: Select a project you want to log time against.
   
   d. **Hourly rate**: This field is automatically populated when you select a project. You can choose for this manual time to be billable or non-billable.
   
   e. **Hours/Minutes**: Type in the hours/minute spent on this task.


4) Click **Save time entry** to log time against the project.
   This time entry will be recorded and displayed on the Time Tracking tab.
