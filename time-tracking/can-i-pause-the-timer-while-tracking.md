# Can I pause or restart the timer while tracking?

No, you cannot pause the timer while tracking a task. 

Instead, you can stop the timer and start it again to keep tracking against the client/project. 
For example, you have logged some time on a client/project and stopped the timer. When you click the start timer next to the tracked time, it will track the time and consolidate the time tracked against the project into a single entry when you are done tracking the hours logged.

**Note**: The time tracking page displays time filtered by all clients in a reverse chronological order, so if you have tracked time over multiple days, they will be displayed as separate entries across these days and not as a single entry.

You will still be able to view the individual times logged/tracked against the project.


### To add to current time logged against a project 

1) On the **Time tracking** page, hover your mouse over to the time you want to add to and click the start button.

2) Stop the timer using the Stop button ![](/assets/stoptimerx.png) against the timer. 
 The new time is consolidated with the existing time entry and displayed under the same description.
