# How do I track time against a project? 

You can keep a track of time spent on a particular project using one of the methods from the Time Tracking page:

a. **Tracking time automatically**

b. **Tracking time manually**

c. **Duplicating existing time entry**

**Before you begin**: We recommend setting up a project (for a client) to track time against, before you start using the Time Tracking feature.

See [Where do I create a new project](/projects/where-do-i-create-a-new-project.md) for more details.


### To track time automatically

1) From the top menu, click **Timer > Time Tracking**.
   The **Time tracking** page displays. 
   
2) To track time for a project automatically, 

a. Type in a note in the **What are you working on** field. 

b. Click **Select project** to select the project you want to track this time against. 
- By default, the time is treated as billable. If you do not to bill the client, click Billable to change time to non billable.
- Depending on what client/project you select, the rate/hour is updated.
