# How do I track time against a project? 

You can keep a track of time spent on a particular project using one of the methods from the Time Tracking page:
a. Tracking time automatically
b. Tracking time manually
c. Duplicating existing time entry

**Before you begin**: We recommend setting up a project (for a client) to track time against, before you start using the Time Tracking feature.
See [Where do I create a new project](/projects/where-do-i-create-a-new-project.md) for more details.


### To track time automatically

1) From the top menu, click **Timer > Time Tracking**.
   The **Time tracking** page displays. 
   
2) To track time for a project automatically, click ![**Start Timer**.](/assets/Start_Timer_button.png)
   The timer is activated and displayed next to the timer button.
   ![](/assets/timer.png)
3) To stop the timer,  click ![](/assets/stoptimer.png).
   The time tracking stops and the time is recorded on the Time Tracking tab.
