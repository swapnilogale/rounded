# Can I track time against a project? 

You can keep a track of time spent on a particular project using the Time Tracking feature. Tracking time allows you to invoice your client (and the project you are working on) accurately.

**Before you begin**: We recommend setting up a project (for a client) to track time against, before you start using the Time Tracking feature.
See [Where do I create a new project](/projects/where-do-i-create-a-new-project.md) for more details.


### To start the timer

   The **Time tracking** page displays. 
   
2) To track time for a project automatically, click ![**Start Timer**.](/assets/Start_Timer_button.png)
