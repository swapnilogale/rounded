# Can I track time against a project? 

Absolutely. You can keep a track of time spent on a particular project using the Time Tracking feature. Tracking time allows you to invoice your client (and the project you are working on) accurately.

**Before you begin**: Make sure you set up a project to track time against, before you start using the Time Tracking feature.


### To start the timer

1. From the top menu, click **Time Tracking**.
   The **Time Tracking** page displays. If you haven't set up a project, you will be prompted to add a new project.
