# How do I delete time entries? 

You can delete time entries using the Time Tracking tab. 

It is very rare that you would want to delete time entries. If you have put in an incorrect time manually or assigned it to an incorrect project, simply click the time entry and edit it with the correct changes. 
    

### To delete time entries

1. From the top menu, click **Time Tracking**.
   The **Time Tracking** tab displays a list of all time tracked against all of your projects.
   
2. Hover your mouse over the time entry you want to delete.
   These options appear just over the time entry.
