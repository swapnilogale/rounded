# Time Tracking

One of the most valuable features of Rounded is the ability to track time against a project so that you can accurately invoice your client for work done on the project. 

**Tip**: If you track time for different kinds of work done, it also helps you to estimate the time required for similar work for future projects.

## Keeping track of time
You can keep a track of time spent on a particular project using one of the methods from the Time Tracking page:

a. **Tracking time automatically** - Track time using Rounded's new timer functionality. Tracked time is grouped by project/client and sorted by dates.

b. **Tracking time manually** - Add time manually for a project/client. Manual time is grouped by project/client and sorted by dates.

c. **Duplicating existing time entry** - Use this feature to duplicate time entries for similar sort of work against the same project/client.
