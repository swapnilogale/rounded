# What are vendors?

A vendor is a business term for anyone who provides goods or services to your company. For example, Telstra or Vodafone for mobile services. 

## Why do I need vendor information?
Vendor information is important to keep track of bills or invoices issued or expenses incurred by your business. You **may** use this to claim deductible items during tax time.

When you first start using Rounded, it comes with a list of some default vendors set up for your business. You can add, delete or edit this vendor information to suit your particular business setup. 
**Note**: There is no limit to the number of vendors you set up in your Rounded account.
