# Are you ready to invoice your clients?
 
This tutorial walks you through the key steps of sending an invoice to your clients using Rounded.

## Here's the story...

You are a freelancer who has just completed some web design work for a client and the client has asked you to submit an invoice for this work in order to get paid. 
 
You have just signed up for Rounded and are not sure what is the best way to go about this. Using the steps below, you will be able to add a client in Rounded, customise your invoice (add logos, company information) and send an invoice to your clients.

### Step 1: Add a client

The first step is to add a client in Rounded. You can either [add a client manually](/clients/can-i-add-clients-manually.md) or [import client data from other systems](/clients/how-do-i-import-client-data-from-external-systems.md). 

A list of your clients will be available on the **Clients** page, accessible from the top menu.

### Step 2: Create and customise an invoice

Once you have created a client, you can create an invoice against the client. 

**To create a new invoice:**

1) Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, navigate to **Invoices &gt; Invoices**.  
  The Invoices page displays.

2) On the Invoices page, click **New Invoice**.
The New invoice for panel slides out from the right. 

3) Click the client you created in Step 1.
A new invoice is created and the draft is displayed.
