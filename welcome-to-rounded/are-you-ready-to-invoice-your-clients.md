# Invoicing your clients
 
This tutorial walks you through the key steps of sending an invoice to your clients. Using Rounded, you can invoice your clients in three steps. 

## Here's the story...

You are a freelancer who has just completed some web design work for a client and the client has asked you to submit an invoice for this work in order to get paid. 
 
You have just signed up for Rounded and are not sure what is the best way to go about this. Using the steps below, you will be able to add a client in Rounded, customise your invoice (add logos, company information) and send an invoice to your clients.

### Step 1: Add a client

The first step is to add a client in Rounded. You can either [add a client manually](/clients/can-i-add-clients-manually.md) or [import client data from other systems](/clients/how-do-i-import-client-data-from-external-systems.md). 

A list of your clients will be available on the **Clients** page, accessible from the top menu.

### Step 2: Create and customise an invoice

Once you have created a client, you can create an invoice against the client. 

**Create and complete a new invoice:**

1) Log in to Rounded and from the top menu, navigate to **Invoices &gt; Invoices**.  
   The Invoices page displays.

2) On the Invoices page, click **New Invoice**.

   The New invoice for panel slides out from the right. 

3) Click the client you created in Step 1.

4) Complete the following:

a. Company Name (Under From), ABN and Address

b. General description

c. Description of work done

d. Hours worked

e. Rate quoted to the client

f. Is the invoice amount applicable for GST

**Customise your invoice **

Once you have filled in the invoice details, you can customise your invoice by uploading your logo. 

To upload your logo:

1) On the draft invoice, click **Upload your logo**.
An explorer dialog displays.

2) Navigate to and click the logo you want to upload to the invoice.

3) Click **OK** to upload the logo.
Your logo is now uploaded and displayed on the invoice.

### Step 3: Send your invoice to the client

Before you send the invoice to the client, preview (using the Preview button) the invoice to make sure you have completed all the fields and uploaded your logo.

1) To send the invoice, click **Ready to Send**.
A new panel slides out from the right. This email is automatically pre-populated with information from the invoice.

2) Type in the email address for the client and modify any email details, if needed.
**Note**: By default, this email will be sent to your email address as a BCC recipient. You will also see the invoice link that is sent to the client for paying the invoice.

3) Click **Send Invoice**.
The invoice is sent to the client via email.
