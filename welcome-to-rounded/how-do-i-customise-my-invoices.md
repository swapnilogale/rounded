The **Settings** page displays.

2) Under **Invoice and Quote settings**, complete the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Default payment terms \(days\) | Type in the payment terms \(days\) applicable to your invoice. This will be displayed on your invoice as the default days for your client to pay you for your invoice. |
| Numbering system | Select a numbering system for your invoices/quotes. You can choose from a simple incremental numbering or a client name prefixed to the numbering. For ex. CL001, CL002 etc. All your invoices for this client will be numbered automatically using this value incrementally.|
| Payment details | Type in the bank details where you want to be paid. Make sure you have the correct bank details \(BSB, Account number & name\). **Note**: Do not type in your Stripe details here. Once you have integrated Stripe with your bank, the link will be automatically included on the invoice. |
| Footer note | Type in a customised footer for your invoices/quotes. |
| Invoice message subject | Type in a customised default invoice message subject. This will display on your invoice messages. **Tip:** You can also edit it dynamically before sending it out. |
| Invoice message | Type in a default body text for your invoice message. **Tip:** You can also edit it dynamically before sending it out. |


3) Click **Save Changes** to make your changes to the account.
