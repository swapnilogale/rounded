# How do I send my invoice to the client

Before you send the invoice to the client, preview (using the Preview button) the invoice to make sure you have completed all the fields and uploaded your logo.

### To send the invoice

1) Open the Invoice you want to send and from the right, click **Ready to Send**.

A new panel slides out from the right. If you have selected the client you want to send this invoice to, the email address is automatically pre-populated with information from the invoice.

2) Type in any additional email addresses for the client or modify any email details, if needed.
**Note**: By default, this email will be sent to your email address as a BCC recipient. You will also see the invoice link that is sent to the client for paying the invoice.
If you click the Attach invoice PDF option, the client will see the invoice as a PDF attachment in their email.

3) Click **Send Invoice**.
The invoice is sent to the client via email.
