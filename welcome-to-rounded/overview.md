# Invoices

An invoice is an itemised list of goods sent or services provided, with a statement of the sum due for these goods or services, called the **Tax invoice**. 

## Generating invoices

Using Rounded, you can generate an invoice using one or both these ways:
a. **Automatic**: Rounded will automatically create an invoice for you and list all the time spent on the project as tracked via the Timer feature. 

b. **Manual**: You can create an invoice and manually add a list of services provided or work completed on a client project.
**Note**: You can use existing line items or create new ones as you add these to the invoice.

## Managing invoices

You can manage (filter, sort, delete, duplicate or generate PDF of) invoices across all your clients using the **Invoices** page.
