# What's on the Dashboard?

When you log in to Rounded, the Dashboard is the first thing you see. It displays the following information:

* Income and Invoices
* Banks and forecasts \(only if you have access to the bank connect functionality\)
* Your financial year
* Top expenses
* Set some goals

**Tip**: It may seem a little empty when you first log in, but once you start invoicing clients and getting paid, the dashboard will start displaying all the relevant information you need to give you a bird's eye view of your business income, expenses and cashflow.
